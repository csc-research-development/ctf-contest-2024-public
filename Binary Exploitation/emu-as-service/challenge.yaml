  honestly it's strange that we have to go through all these steps to get the famous "Ot0R!Emu" secrets.
  she made prod and demo version and both of them have some kind of key for protection, too bad im only manage to steal the demo version :(
  so rn your goal is to hacked into emu otori service and obtain the secret of society message!
  the demo version had prebuilt-in keys so don't worry to much ;)
